# Computationnal Imaging working group for radio-astronomy

The working group focuses on computational imaging for radio astronomy in
relation to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project, the largest radio
interferometer set to deploy its first phase in 2024. This project, which
involves high-performance computing to process 7.2 Tb/s of raw data, brings
together experts from Paris-Saclay across various disciplines. Participants
include astrophysicists and researchers in digital sciences, data science, and
artificial intelligence. Several laboratories are involved, such as L2S, SATIE,
CEA, and IAS, contributing expertise in statistical signal processing, algorithm
optimization, data calibration, and high-performance computing. The group aims
to foster collaboration through regular seminars and a funded Masterâ€™s
internship to explore advanced computational imaging and statistical methods
