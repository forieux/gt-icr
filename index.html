The working group focuses on computational imaging and statistical data processing methods for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project, leveraging high-performance computing to process massive radio astronomy data. It brings together experts from Paris-Saclay in astrophysics, digital sciences, data science, and AI to advance methods in signal processing, algorithm optimization, and data calibration.
