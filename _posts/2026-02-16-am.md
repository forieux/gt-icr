_Abstract_ (assisted by AI): This presentation introduces IViS (Interferometric Visibility-domain Inversion Software), a green and scalable imaging framework designed for the SKA era, developed to process large HI surveys such as GASKAP-HI with ASKAP. It revisits joint deconvolution through a non-linear optimization approach applied directly in the visibility domain, combining multiple beams into a single cost function with spatial regularization to improve image fidelity. Implemented in PyTorch and accelerated with GPU-based NuFFT, IViS aims to address key challenges of deep integration, image quality, and computational sustainability. The method is validated using synthetic observations and real ASKAP data, comparing joint deconvolution with traditional linear mosaicking, and demonstrating its relevance for next-generation large-scale radio surveys.
