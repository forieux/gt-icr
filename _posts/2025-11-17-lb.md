_Resume (assisted by AI)_: This work explores how antenna array configurations influence image reconstruction performance in radio interferometry and proposes using estimation error lower bounds as design criteria. After presenting the interferometric measurement model, uv-plane sampling, and point-spread function formation, the study examines classical and advanced MSE bounds—such as the Cramér–Rao and Barankin bounds—and illustrates their relevance through a frequency estimation example. These bounds are then applied to a single-source direction-of-arrival model to guide optimal antenna placement, demonstrating improved performance over traditional criteria. The approach highlights both the potential of statistically grounded design and its current limitations, motivating ongoing efforts within the ANR PerDRIX project to develop more appropriate cost functions, scalable optimization methods, and more realistic interferometric models.
