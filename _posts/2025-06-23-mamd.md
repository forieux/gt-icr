_Resume by AI_: This presentation exposes an overview of the science of neutral hydrogen (HI) in galaxies, focusing on 21 cm observations and their role in understanding galactic structure, dynamics, and star formation processes. They highlight methodological advances in hyperspectral data analysis, such as Gaussian decomposition and CNM/WNM separation, which enable deeper insights into the diffuse interstellar medium. The GASKAP project, a major ASKAP key survey, is introduced as the largest HI mapping effort to date, covering the Milky Way and Magellanic System with unprecedented resolution and data volume. Processing challenges—such as handling petabyte-scale datasets, imaging diffuse emission across multiple spatial scales, and developing new joint deconvolution techniques—are discussed as crucial steps toward preparing for the SKA. Ultimately, GASKAP is presented as a transformative resource for studying HI from sub-parsec to 100 kpc scales, bridging local and extragalactic environments.
